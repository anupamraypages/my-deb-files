 Security Notice: How to Safely Download and Verify Files

 Warning: Use Trusted Sources Only

While our repository is public and accessible to anyone, we strongly recommend that you only download files from trusted and official sources. Downloading files from unofficial or unverified locations may expose you to malware, viruses, or other security risks. Please ensure that you are always downloading from this official repository or any other trusted and secure platforms.

 How to Verify Files Before Installation

To ensure the integrity and authenticity of the files you are downloading, we advise you to use verification methods such as checksums or digital signatures. These methods will allow you to confirm that the file has not been tampered with and is safe to install.

 1. Verifying with Checksums (SHA256)

Checksums are unique hash values that represent the contents of a file. If the file’s checksum matches the one listed in this README, you can be confident that the file is genuine and has not been altered. Here’s how you can verify the checksum:

 Step 1: Download the file from this repository.
 Step 2: Obtain the checksum of the downloaded file. On Linux, you can use the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    sha256sum filename.deb
    ```

    On Windows, use the `CertUtil` command:

    ```powershell
    CertUtil hashfile filename.deb SHA256
    ```

 Step 3: Compare the checksum output with the one provided below:

    Example checksum for file_name.deb:
    ```
    8b5fc1db2d5104e7f1c9782b09e0f256d5bb4933a988a8325c9f5fbb8b9251cf
    ```

    If the checksums match, the file is legitimate and safe to install. If they don’t match, do not install the file and delete it.

 2. Verifying with Digital Signatures

A digital signature provides an additional layer of security by confirming that the file was signed by the legitimate publisher and hasn’t been altered. To verify a file’s digital signature:

 Step 1: Download the file and its accompanying signature file (if provided).
 Step 2: Use a tool like `GPG` or `Gpg4win` to verify the signature. For example, using GPG:

    ```bash
    gpg verify file_name.sig file_name.deb
    ```

    This will check if the file’s signature matches and if it was signed by a trusted key.

 Step 3: Ensure that the public key used to sign the file is trusted. You can find the public key in the project documentation or from a trusted keyserver.

 What to Do If Verification Fails

If the checksum or digital signature does not match, do not install the file. This may indicate that the file has been altered or corrupted. In this case, please report the issue immediately to the repository maintainers.

By including this information in your README file, you help users understand the importance of file verification and provide them with the tools and methods to ensure they are downloading safe and authentic files.
